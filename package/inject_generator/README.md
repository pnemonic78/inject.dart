# `package:inject_generator`

This is the dev-time dependency for `package:inject2`.

**NOTE**: This is _not_ an official Google or Dart team project.

This package only handles compiling your classes and annotations into Dart code
(`*.inject.dart` files). For most users, see the
[`README.md` for `package:inject2` instead](../inject/README.md).

## To run the test suite

```bash
$ pub run test
```
